## ðŸŸ¢ Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). The LTS version should be fine. 
- You will also need the `npm` package manager (which comes with Node.js).
- A development environment or IDE with TypeScript support will help. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a good choice.

```shell
