### Modularization and Structure

* **Separate Page Components**
    * Since the login page has distinct features (e.g. username login, social logins, forgot password), the creation of separate classes for each using the component-based approach enhances maintainability and code organization by breaking down complex pages into smaller, reusable components.
        ```
        In Playwright, the concept of a component class facilitates the creation of reusable and maintainable test code for web components. It involves encapsulating the logic and locators related to a specific component within a class, promoting a modular and organized approach to testing. This pattern enhances code readability, reduces redundancy, and simplifies test maintenance.
        ```
        **How This Improves Scalability:**
        * When new social login options are added, or if the forgot password flow changes, you only modify the relevent component.
        * If a component is reused on other pages, you have already built the testing logic.
        * If a change to the UI requires a locator change, only the component file that contains that locator needs to be edited.

        **Benefits of Direct Component Interaction:**
        * **Clarity:** It's immediately clear which component is being used in the test.
        * **Isolation:** Components remain isolated and testable independently.
        * **Maintainability:** Changes to a component only affect the component's code and its associated tests.
        * **Simplicity:** The parent page object remains clean and focused.

* **Separate Test Files**
    * Since the login page has distinct features (e.g. username login, social logins, forgot password), separate test files for each allows each test file to focus on a specific aspect of the login functionality.

* **Base Page Class:**
    * Creation of a base page class with common methods like `gotoPage` promotes code reuse and prevents repetitive setup logic in page objects.

* **Folder Structure:**
    * Organizing the Page Object Model (POM) and tests into folders based on features help to organize the project and promotes a well-organized and maintainable test automation framework.
        **Benefits:**
        * **Clear Separation: ** Page objects, tests, and utilities are separated
        * **Modularity: ** Each component and test file has a specific purpose.
        * **Scalability: ** Easy to add new pages, components, and tests as the application grows.
        * ** Maintainability: ** Easier to find and modify specific parts of the test suite.
        * **Readability: ** The structure is easy to understand and navigate.

### Data Abstraction

* **Test Data Files**
    * Storing test data (usernames, passwords, error messages) in separate files allows for easy management and updates to test data without modifying the test code.

### Scalability and Reusability

* **Utility Functions**
    * Creating utility functions for common tasks like getting environment 

### Naming Conventions

* **Kebab-Case**
    * Kebab-case is widely used in web development, especially in file naming for CSS, HTML, and increasingly in JavaScript/TypeScript projects. It promotes consistency across your codebase and makes it easier for developers to understand and follow the naming conventions. Hyphens make it easier to visually separate works in file names, imrpoving readability.
