### Locators

* **Consistent Locators**
    * Stick to a consistent locator strategy (e.g. data-qa-id or well-defined CSS selectors)

* **Centralized Locator Management**
    * Consider using a separate file or configuration for managing locators, especially if they are used across multiple pages.

### Data Abstraction

* **Data Generation**
    * For more complex test scenarios, you can use libraries like `faker.js` to generate realistic test data.

### Assertion Improvements

* **Soft Assertions**
    * If you want to gather multiple assertion failures, look into soft assertions.

### Robustness and Error Handling:

* **Retry Logic**
    * Implement retry logic for flaky elements or actions.

* **Timeout Management:**
    * Adjust timeouts based on expected page load times and network conditions.

* **Error Handling:**
    * Use try...catch blocks to handle exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.

### Scalability and Reusability

* **Parameterization**
    * Parameterize methods to handle different scenarios (e.g., different user roles).

* **Utility Functions**
    * Create utility functions for common tasks like date formatting or string manipulation.

* **Parallel Execution**
    * Playwright's parallel execution capabilities can be used to run tests faster.

### Consistency
    * The long functionality has different error messages. It's a good practice to investigate why the messages differ.

### Test Isolation:

    * In the Forgot Password: Reset Password test, there are nested test.step blocks. While this can be useful for organization, ensure that these steps are truly independent and don't rely on the state of previous steps to maintain test isolation.
